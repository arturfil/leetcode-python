## In this repo I'm going to put all the solutions in python

I'ts funny cause with python you can be blazing fast in coding interviews (hence flash)
But in general python is a slow language when ti comes to processing speed
<br/>
<br/>
Since we are focusing on BigO (time complexity) & Memory Efficiency, we don't really care
that python is slow in processing cause it's blazing fast when it comes to writing algos.
<br/>
<br/>
It also happens to be super readable (almost pseudo code) which makes it better for both
candidate and intreviewer (at least that's my take).
<br/>
<br/>
And thus, I created s run.sh shell script to run main.py
main.py is like your main file in java, csharp, c, c++ etc. 
I like to keep that strucutre that way when you move to other languages it's not that
different.

To allow your computer to run the exec.sh script:
```
chmod 755 exec.sh
```

To run the shell script I just press "./e" and tab so it autocompletes the run.sh script
