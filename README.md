# Leetcode Python3

## In this repo I'm going to put all the solutions in python

I created s run.sh shell script to run main.py
main.py is like your main file in java, csharp, c, c++ etc. 
I like to keep that strucutre that way when you move to other languages it's not that
different.

To allow your computer to run the run.sh script:
```
chmod 755
```

To run the shell script I just press "./r" and tab so it autocompletes the run.sh script
